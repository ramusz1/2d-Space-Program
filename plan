MODEL - VIEW - CONTROL

Graphics engine:
    - draw objects
    - draw menu
    - draw predicted paths of motion

Physics engine:
    - applying direct force to an object
    - applying gravitational force
    - calculating trajectory of a given body
    - drag ?
    - managing weak gravitational forces from far away planets
    - collision detection
    - fast forward

Player interaction:
    - interpret keyboard input
    - interpret mouse input
    - menu interactions



TODOS - next tasks:
- scale of the universe and camera operating
- phycisc - circular movement has to be cool
- advanced physics - collisions
- draw and controll more complex objects
- physics vol.3 computing trajectory


TODO - side quests, good ideas:
+ GSLwrapper - GLM used instead
- inspect (remove?) usleep in main
- objects are connected through references - good for now, but if swapping occures than a refactoring will be needed
