MODEL - VIEW - CONTROL

Graphics engine:
    - draw objects
    - draw menu
    - draw predicted paths of motion

Physics engine:
    - applying direct force to an object
    - applying gravitational force
    - calculating trajectory of a given body
    - drag ?
    - managing weak gravitational forces from far away planets
    - collision detection
    - fast forward

Player interaction:
    - interpret keyboard input
    - interpret mouse input
    - menu interactions



TODOS - next tasks:
- fix makefile
- draw objects - triangle, circle, square
- control objects
- basic physics - gravity, velocity, acceleration, time - faster slower
- phycisc - circular movement has to be cool
- advanced physics - collisions
- draw and controll more complex objects
- physics vol.3 computing trajectory


TODO - side quests, good ideas:
- GSLwrapper
